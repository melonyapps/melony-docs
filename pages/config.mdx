# Configuration

Melony keeps things simple with a single configuration file that lets you tailor it to your exact needs. This file acts as the central control panel for your production-ready full-stack application.

Here's a quick breakdown of the key configuration options:

- <Code>id:</Code> Give your app a unique identifier. Think of it as a name tag for
  your admin panel.

- <Code>ui:</Code> This is where you get to personalize the user interface! Add your
  logo, set your app's name, and configure custom navigation elements in the sidebar
  to match your brand.

- <Code>collections:</Code> Here's where the magic happens. Define the schemas (structure)
  for your MongoDB collections, configure how you want them displayed (views), and
  specify actions users can take on the data.

- <Code>triggers:</Code> Automate tasks with triggers! Listen for any changes in
  your database or schedule events to fire custom functions. This allows you to create
  powerful background jobs for streamlining your application logic.

## Example

```js
import { Config, fields, triggers, views } from "@melony/core/config";

export const melonyConfig: Config = {
  id: "your-app-name",
  ui: {
    logo: "🤗",
    title: "App Title Here",
  },
  collections: [
    {
      slug: "tasks",
      label: "Tasks",
      schema: [
        fields.input({ slug: "title" }),
        fields.select({ slug: "status" }),
      ],
      views: [
        views.cards({
          slug: "tasksAssignedToMe",
          label: "My Tasks",
          icon: "📝",
        }),
      ],
    },
  ],
  triggers: [
    triggers.db({
      slug: "autoIncrementTaskId",
      listen: "tasks",
      on: ["create"],
      func: async ({ db, type, oldDocument, newDocument }) => {
        // your custom function goes here
      },
    }),
  ],
};
```
