# Triggers

The <Code>triggers</Code> section within your project configuration file unlocks the power of automation. Here, you can define triggers that react to specific events or run on a scheduled basis, allowing you to automate tasks and enhance the functionality of your admin panel.

Trigger Types:

## Database Triggers:

Respond to changes within your MongoDB collections. You can define triggers that execute custom functions whenever a document is inserted, updated, or deleted. This allows for real-time data processing, validation, or triggering of other actions based on database events.

## Scheduled Triggers:

Take control with pre-defined schedules. Set up triggers to run your custom functions at specific intervals or on recurring timeframes. This empowers you to automate tasks like data backups, sending notifications, or performing periodic data analysis.
