# Collections

The <Code>collections</Code> section within your configuration file is the heart of your data management. Here, you'll define how your MongoDB collections are structured, displayed, and interacted with.

## Example

```js
import { Config, fields, triggers, views } from "@melony/core/config";

export const melonyConfig: Config = {
  id: "your-app-name",
  ...
  collections: [
    {
        slug: "tasks",
        label: "Tasks",
        schema: [
            fields.input({ slug: "title" }),
            fields.select({ slug: "status" }),
        ],
        views: [
            views.cards({
            slug: "tasksAssignedToMe",
            label: "My Tasks",
            icon: "📝",
            }),
        ],
        actions: [{
            slug: "sendBulkEmail",
            func: async ({ db, documents }) => {
                // your custom function goes here
            }
        }],
    },
  ],
  ...
};
```

Collection params:

## Slug

<Code>slug</Code> (Unique Identifier): This acts as a "collection path" or "table
name". It must be unique within your configuration.

## Label

<Code>label</Code> (Human-Readable Name): This is the user-friendly name that will
be displayed throughout the admin panel interface for your collection.

## Schema

<Code>schema</Code> (Structuring Your Data): Define the structure of your data within
the collection. This is similar to a blueprint, specifying the data types (like strings,
numbers, or booleans) for each field within your documents.

## Views

<Code>views</Code> (Customizing Data Display): Control how your collection's data
is presented in the admin panel. You can define multiple views, each showcasing a
specific selection of fields or utilizing different layouts to best suit your needs.

## Actions

<Code>actions</Code> (Taking Control with Custom Functionality): Empower your users
with custom actions! This section allows you to define functions that can be performed
on individual documents or selected sets of documents within your collection. Common
examples include actions like "move", "send mail", or "delete selected".

We'll delve deeper into schema, views and actions in the next sections, providing a detailed explanation of how to configure them effectively.
